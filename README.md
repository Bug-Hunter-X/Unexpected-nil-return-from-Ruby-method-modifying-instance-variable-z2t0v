This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Ruby related to implicit nil returns from methods modifying instance variables.  The `bug.rb` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rb` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when a method modifies an instance variable but lacks an explicit return statement, resulting in an implicit return of `nil`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent parts of the program. The solution involves adding an explicit `return` statement to ensure the method returns the expected value.
